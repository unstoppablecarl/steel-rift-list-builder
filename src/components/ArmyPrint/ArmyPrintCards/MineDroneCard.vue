        <div><strong>Placing:</strong> May not be placed within 6” of another friendly Mine Drone token.</div>

        <div><strong>Triggered:</strong>
          If an enemy model ends any Order within 4”, the Commander may remove the token to make an Engage Order with an
          Attack against that model and all other enemy models in range. Line of Sight for this Attack is drawn from the
          Target Model to itself (therefore it is never obstructed). The token and Active Unit do not require Line of
          Sight to each other, as the Drones will attack using their sensors. Units may not Return Fire during this
          attack. Once this Engage Order is resolved remove the token. Once this is complete the Active Player may
          continue issuing any remaining orders to the Active Model.
        </div>

        <div><strong>Targeted:</strong> When targeted by an attack from <span class="fw-medium">Mine Drone Tracking
          Submunitions</span> the target Minefield
          makes a Defense Roll on a 3+. If at least one point of Damage would be inflicted, remove the Token.
